# ideal

Christopher Van Wyk's IDEAL picture language redone in Python: or
anyway, some subset thereof, as far as I get, for the sake of
understanding it better.

The full language is explained in the [IDEAL User's
Manual](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/groff/103.ps).

This uses [Parson](https://github.com/darius/parson) for parsing.

Other interpreters I know of (and so far have only glanced at):

  * [Original IDEAL](http://freaknet.org/martin/tape/stuff/ditroff/ideal/)
  * [Argand](https://github.com/ALPHA-60/argand)
