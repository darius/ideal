# ideal

Christopher Van Wyk's IDEAL picture language redone in Python: or
anyway, some subset thereof, as far as I get, for the sake of
understanding it better.

The full language is explained in the [IDEAL User's
Manual](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/groff/103.ps).

This uses [Parson](https://github.com/darius/parson) for parsing.
